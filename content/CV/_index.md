## Publications
* Caio Lorecchio, Daniel Monte (2023). [Bad Reputation with Simple Rating Systems](https://caiolorecchio.github.io/publication/bad-reputation-simple-rating-systems/). *Games and Economic Behavior*, 142, 150-178.
  * We explore how simple rating systems can mitigate the negative effects of reputational concerns in online reputation systems, particularly in scenarios involving long-lived experts and short-lived customers.
  
* Caio Lorecchio, Daniel Monte (2023). [Dynamic Information Design under Constrained Communication Rules](https://caiolorecchio.github.io/publication/dynamic-information-design-constrained-communication-rules/). *American Economic Journal: Microeconomics*, 15(1), 359-98.
  * We examine how an information designer can persuade agents to invest in a project under communication constraints that limit belief spread and hinder persuasion.

## Ongoing Projects
* Caio Lorecchio, Oriol Tejada, Gerard Domènech-Gironell (2024). [Information Acquisition in Deliberative Democracies](https://caiolorecchio.github.io/publication/information-acquisition-deliberative-democracies/). *Under review*.
  * We study how deliberation in democracies impacts costly information acquisition and electoral outcomes. While it can enhance legitimacy and accuracy, it may also lead to free-riding or over-reliance on political experts.
  
* Caio Lorecchio, William Fuchs, Vladimir Asriyan (2024). [Multilateral Bargaining with Information Spillovers](https://caiolorecchio.github.io/publication/multilateral-bargaining-information-spillovers/). *Work in progress*.
  * Correlated demands rationalize more dynamic pricing than what classic bargaining models suggest.
  
* Caio Lorecchio, Braz Camargo, Laura Karpuska (2023). [Political Accountability and Misinformation](https://caiolorecchio.github.io/publication/political-accountability-and-misinformation/). *Work in progress*.
  * We study how misinformation affects political accountability. Misinformation can negatively impact effective accountability, but also, perhaps counter-intuitively, can increase it.
  
* Caio Lorecchio (2022). [Persuading Crowds](https://caiolorecchio.github.io/publication/persuading-crowds/). *Working paper*.
  * I examine crowd manipulation through dynamic info design, and show when to induce herd behavior from the outset and when to withold decisive releases for later periods.
